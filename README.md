4. On the Credentials page, get an API key (and set the API key restrictions). Note: If you have an existing unrestricted API key, or a key with browser restrictions, you may use that key.
5. To prevent quota theft and secure your API key, see Using API Keys.

7. Copy the entire code of this tutorial from this page, to your text editor.
8. In file index.html replace the value of the key parameter in the URL with your own API key (that's the API key that you've just obtained).
